## Introduction

This is my first *Quarto* document and I am going to plot some penguin data.

We are also learning basic Quarto. Here are all the ways I can change an 

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Look at the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Make a plot
This looks at the relationship between **bill length** and **bill depth**.

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins %>% # penguin dataset
  ggplot(aes(
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
