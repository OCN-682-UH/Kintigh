# Kintigh - OCN682

This repository contains coursework for my **Data Science Fundamentals in R** class. It serves as a central location for assignments, exercises, and projects completed throughout Fall 2025. Each week is stored in its own folder (e.g., `Week_02`, `Week_03`, etc.) and follows a consistent structure to stay organized. However, all folders are associated with the same overarching R project (**Kintigh.Rproj**).

## Structure

-   **Week\_##/** – Separate R Project for each week
    -   **Data/** – Input datasets used for analyses
    -   **Scripts/** – R scripts and functions
    -   **Output/** – Results, plots, and processed data

## Purpose

This repo demonstrates my progress in learning R, including:

-   Writing and organizing reproducible R code
-   Practicing Git/GitHub workflows
-   Building skills in data analysis and visualization
